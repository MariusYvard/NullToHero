# Color & Contrast

## Color Spaces: Use OKLCH

**Stop using HSL.** Use OKLCH (or LCH) instead. It's perceptually uniform, meaning equal steps in lightness *look* equal—unlike HSL where 50% lightness in yellow looks bright while 50% in blue looks dark.

The OKLCH function takes three components: `oklch(lightness chroma hue)` where lightness is 0-100%, chroma is roughly 0-0.4, and hue is 0-360. To build a primary color and its lighter / darker variants, hold the chroma+hue roughly constant and vary the lightness — but **reduce chroma as you approach white or black**, because high chroma at extreme lightness looks garish.

The hue you pick is a brand decision and should not come from a default. Do not reach for blue (hue 250) or warm orange (hue 60) by reflex — those are the dominant AI-design defaults, not the right answer for any specific brand.

## Building Functional Palettes

### Tinted Neutrals

**Pure gray is dead.** A neutral with zero chroma feels lifeless next to a colored brand. Add a tiny chroma value (0.005-0.015) to all your neutrals, hued toward whatever your brand color is. The chroma is small enough not to read as "tinted" consciously, but it creates subconscious cohesion between brand color and UI surfaces.

**Avoid** the trap of always tinting toward warm orange or always tinting toward cool blue. Those are the two laziest defaults and they create their own monoculture across projects.

### Palette Structure

A complete system needs:

| Role | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Primary** | Brand, CTAs, key actions | 1 color, 3-5 shades |
| **Neutral** | Text, backgrounds, borders | 9-11 shade scale |
| **Semantic** | Success, error, warning, info | 4 colors, 2-3 shades each |
| **Surface** | Cards, modals, overlays | 2-3 elevation levels |

**Skip secondary/tertiary unless you need them.** Most apps work fine with one accent color.

### The 60-30-10 Rule (Applied Correctly)

- **60%**: Neutral backgrounds, white space, base surfaces
- **30%**: Secondary colors — text, borders, inactive states
- **10%**: Accent — CTAs, highlights, focus states

The common mistake: using the accent color everywhere because it's "the brand color." Accent colors work *because* they're rare. Overuse kills their power.

## Contrast & Accessibility

### WCAG Requirements

| Content Type | AA Minimum | AAA Target |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| Body text | 4.5:1 | 7:1 |
| Large text (18px+ or 14px bold) | 3:1 | 4.5:1 |
| UI components, icons | 3:1 | 4.5:1 |
| Non-essential decorations | None | None |

### Dangerous Color Combinations

- Light gray text on white (the #1 accessibility fail)
- **Gray text on any colored background** — gray looks washed out and dead on color. Use a darker shade of the background color, or transparency
- Red text on green background (or vice versa) — 8% of men can't distinguish these
- Blue text on red background (vibrates visually)
- Yellow text on white (almost always fails)

### Never Use Pure Gray or Pure Black

Pure gray (`oklch(50% 0 0)`) and pure black (`#000`) don't exist in nature — real shadows and surfaces always have a color cast. Even a chroma of 0.005-0.01 is enough to feel natural.

## Theming: Light & Dark Mode

### Dark Mode Is Not Inverted Light Mode

| Light Mode | Dark Mode |
|------------|-----------|
| Shadows for depth | Lighter surfaces for depth (no shadows) |
| Dark text on light | Light text on dark (reduce font weight) |
| Vibrant accents | Desaturate accents slightly |
| White backgrounds | Never pure black — use dark gray (oklch 12-18%) |

In dark mode, depth comes from surface lightness, not shadow. Build a 3-step surface scale where higher elevations are lighter (e.g. 15% / 20% / 25% lightness).

### Token Hierarchy

Use two layers: primitive tokens (`--blue-500`) and semantic tokens (`--color-primary: var(--blue-500)`). For dark mode, only redefine the semantic layer.

## Alpha Is A Design Smell

Heavy use of transparency (rgba, hsla) usually means an incomplete palette. Alpha creates unpredictable contrast, performance overhead, and inconsistency. Define explicit overlay colors for each context instead.

**Avoid**: Relying on color alone to convey information. Using pure black (#000) for large areas. Skipping color blindness testing (8% of men affected).
